With over 20 years of security experience and more than a decade serving clients statewide, our patrol officers deliver professional protection backed by advanced reporting technology.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>

      <h3>Why Choose Proactive Mobile Patrol?</h3>
      <p>
        Mobile patrol is one of the most effective and cost-efficient security solutions for properties that do not require a full-time on-site guard. The unpredictability of our patrol schedule keeps criminals guessing—making your property a much harder target.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Theft & vandalism</li>
        <li>Trespassing & loitering</li>
        <li>Homeless activity & suspicious persons</li>
        <li>After-hours access violations</li>
        <li>Suspicious vehicles</li>
        <li>Break-ins & burglary attempts</li>
